## To do list:
The list is roughly ordered by priority. 

* change topbar to have a absolute height instead of relative
* change sidebar to be a list similar to transaction list
* Add transaction column descriptions - Date | Account | Amount | ...
* add cancel button to InputBox
* change date time string returned from datepicker to the format dd.mm.yyyy
* dynamically adapt transaction grid widths to content
